# Go Coding Standards, Testing Standards, and Lessons Learned

Read this before creating, editing, or refactoring any `.go` file. It is the
project-specific complement to `AGENTS.md`'s always-loaded core — everything
here is scoped to Go source and doesn't need to be in context for a
docs-only or UI-only change.

## Go Coding Standards

### Idioms (Required)

- **Accept interfaces, return structs**. Define interfaces at the consumer side, not the producer side.
- **Small interfaces**. Single-method interfaces are good. Compose with embedding when needed.
- **Context propagation**. Every blocking operation accepts `context.Context` as its first parameter.
- **Error wrapping**. Use `fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", err)` to preserve error chains. Never use `%v` on errors.
- **Structured logging**. Use `log/slog`. Pass `*slog.Logger` via constructor; do not use a package-level global logger. **All loggers must be component-scoped** using `.With("component", "name")` to support log filtering.
- **Goroutine lifecycle**. Every goroutine has a clearly defined exit condition tied to a context, channel close, or explicit signal. No "fire and forget" goroutines.
- **Standard library first**. Prefer `slices`, `maps`, `errors.Is/As`, and `min`/`max` builtins over custom helpers or reflection.

### Anti-Patterns (Forbidden)

- **No `panic` for control flow.** Panic is for unrecoverable programmer errors only.
- **No silent error swallowing.** `_ = doSomething()` requires a comment explaining why the error is intentionally ignored.
- **No `time.Sleep` in tests** for synchronization. Use channels, `sync.WaitGroup`, or `chan struct{}` signals.
- **No `init()` functions** for non-trivial setup. Use explicit `New*` constructors called from `main`.
- **No global mutable state.** Configuration, loggers, and dependencies are passed explicitly.
- **No `interface{}` / `any`** in new code unless absolutely required (e.g., generic JSON handling). Prefer concrete types or generics. When a dynamic type is necessary, prefer `any` over `interface{}`.

### Database Migrations

All schema changes MUST be implemented as a new `goose` migration file in
`internal/history/migrations/`. **Never modify existing migration files.**

### Concurrency Architecture (Decided)

The architecture establishes specific concurrency patterns. Follow them:

- **Dispatcher → Downloader signaling**: channel-based (`chan struct{}`, cap=1, non-blocking send — `Dispatcher.Notify` hands out the receive end, `Dispatcher.Wake` does the `select`/`default` send). NOT `sync.Cond`. Rationale in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § Coordination Architecture.
- **Dispatcher internal locking**: two mutexes with different disciplines, and they are not interchangeable.
    - `d.mu sync.Mutex` guards the per-job bookkeeping maps. Take it, touch one map, release — it must not be held across a call into `sched` or `Residency.Hydrate`, nor across any I/O.
    - `d.storeMu sync.Mutex` serializes store writes so a `Save` cannot race a `Delete` (`registry.go`, `tick.go`). It is *deliberately* held across blocking SQLite calls — that is its entire job, and `tick.go`'s `store.Save` carries a `//lockio:` waiver saying so — so the "touch one map, release" rule does not apply to it. What does apply: `storeMu` is the OUTER lock. `persistIfChanged` takes `storeMu` then `d.mu` to re-check the registry before writing; never invert that. Neither lock may be held across a call into `sched` or `Residency.Hydrate`.
- **Per-job locking**: two `sync.RWMutex` on `job.Job` — `mu` for the header tier, `contentMu` for the evictable manifest/progress tier. `mu` is the OUTER lock; never take it while holding `contentMu`.
- **Article cache**: `sync.RWMutex` + `atomic.Int64` for memory tracking.
- **Downloader main loop**: `select{}` over multiple channels.

If a new component needs coordination, document the choice (mutex vs channel vs other) in a comment near its declaration.

### Persistence (Decided)

- **Queue state**: active job metadata and progress in SQLite (`dispatch_jobs` and `job_files` tables — the legacy `jobs` table was dropped by migration `006_recovery_bytes_and_retire_jobs.sql`); immutable article manifests in gzip JSON (`adminDir/queue/manifests/<id>.json.gz`).
- **History**: SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGO).
- **Config**: YAML via `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`.
- **Atomic writes**: all file persistence uses temp file + fsync + rename; queue-to-history transitions execute atomically within a single database transaction.

Rationale is documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Do not deviate without escalating.

## Library Selection

Prefer existing, well-maintained Go libraries over custom implementations. Before writing utility code, search for an existing solution.

When evaluating a new library:
- Check last commit date (active in last 12 months)
- Check open issues for concerning bugs
- Check that it has tests and reasonable test coverage
- Verify license compatibility (GPL-2.0+ for SABnzbd compatibility)
- Escalate the addition for user approval

## Testing Standards

- **Table-driven tests** with subtests (`t.Run`) for each case.
- **`-race` flag** required for tests involving goroutines or shared state.
- **Test files alongside source**: `foo.go` ↔ `foo_test.go`.
- **Test helpers** in `testhelper_test.go` or a `testdata/` package.
- **Integration tests** under `test/integration/` with `//go:build integration` tag.
- **Mocks/fakes** preferred over interface mocking frameworks. Hand-rolled fakes are clearer than `gomock`-generated ones for small interfaces.
- **Coverage target**: 80%+ for `internal/` packages. Don't chase coverage for trivial code paths.

### Coverage Exemptions

The `scripts/check_coverage` tool enforces an 80% per-function threshold on
changed code. Some functions are **trivially correct by inspection** and testing
them adds no confidence — e.g., no-op interface stubs, single-field getters, or
type-assertion wrappers. **Do not insert dead code** (like `_ = struct{}{}`)
to make the coverage tool instrument empty method bodies. That is coverage
gaming, not testing.

Instead, mark the function with a `//nocover:` comment on the `func` line
explaining *why* testing provides no value:

```go
func (d dummyEmitter) Broadcast(_ Event) {} //nocover: no-op interface stub
```

The coverage checker skips any function whose declaration line contains
`//nocover:`. The comment MUST include a reason after the colon. Functions
eligible for exemption:

- **No-op interface stubs** (empty method bodies satisfying an interface).
- **Trivial getters/setters** with no logic, branching, or side effects.
- **Compile-time interface checks** (`var _ Foo = (*Bar)(nil)`).

Functions NOT eligible — these must be tested:

- Anything with branching (`if`, `switch`, `for`).
- Anything with error handling or error wrapping.
- Anything that mutates shared state.

### Test Alignment & No Dummy References (Mandatory)

The `scripts/check_test_alignment` tool verifies that unexported helpers with cyclomatic complexity ≥ 8 in modified files are covered by direct unit tests in the same package.

**Agents MUST NOT add dummy tests, fake variable assignments (e.g., `var _ = helper` or `_ = (Type{}).method`), or stub references simply to satisfy `check_test_alignment` or artificial coverage metrics.** Dummy references are test gaming and conceal untested logic.

When `check_test_alignment` reports an unexported helper gap, agents MUST choose one of two valid resolutions:

1. **Write Real Unit Tests**: Implement meaningful, thorough unit tests in the package test suite (`_test.go`) that directly exercise the helper, asserting expected returns, boundary conditions, and error branches.
2. **Exempt Trivial Code (`//nocover:`)**: If the helper is trivially correct by inspection (e.g., no-op stub, simple getter), mark the function declaration line with a `//nocover: <reason>` comment providing a clear justification. The `check_test_alignment` script (matching `check_coverage`) honors `//nocover:` comments and skips exempted functions.

### Red-Green Discipline (write the failing test first)

**Every bug fix and every regression test MUST be proven to fail on the
unpatched code before the fix lands.** A test that already passes against the
buggy code does not test the fix — it is a change-detector that will silently
let the bug return. This has happened here repeatedly: tests named for a fix
that still passed with the fix reverted (a `"1.0 TiB"` case that never reached
the panicking branch; a `download.nzb` fallback case that never exercised the
fixed `/` path). A passing test is not evidence until you have seen it fail for
the right reason.

The required order for any fix:

1. **Write the test first**, encoding the *correct* expected behavior (not the
   current output — assert what the code *should* do, with an independent oracle
   where possible).
2. **Run it against the unfixed code and watch it FAIL.** For a pre-existing
   bug, write the test before touching the code. For a regression guard added
   alongside a fix, revert the fix and confirm the test goes red. Read the
   failure message — it must fail because of the bug, not a typo or wrong setup.

   Use `scripts/mutate` rather than reverting by hand. Write a spec naming the
   package, the test, and each mutation; it applies them one at a time,
   requires each to produce a red result, and restores the file on every exit
   path including SIGINT:

   ```bash
   go run ./scripts/mutate path/to/the.spec
   ```

   ```text
   pkg ./internal/pkg/
   run TestTheNewPin

   [the guard neutered]
   file internal/pkg/target.go
   --- anchor
   	if deadline.IsZero() {
   --- replace
   	if true {
   --- end
   ```

   **`-count=1` is not optional, which is why the runner always passes it.**
   Go caches a passing result keyed on the test binary and its inputs, so a
   mutation run without it can replay the *pre-mutation* pass and print `ok`
   — which reads as "the test does not discriminate" and is the exact
   opposite of the truth. The hand-rolled snippet that stood here omitted the
   flag entirely.

   **Never `git stash`** — the stash stack is shared with any other session
   working in this repo, and a pop can take their work. Prefer restoring from
   your own copy over `git checkout -- <path>`, which also discards any
   unrelated uncommitted edits in that file.

   **Revert each half separately.** A fix touching two call sites needs two
   reverts; one half being pinned says nothing about the other.

   **Prefer neutering a condition to deleting a block.** Deleting often breaks
   the build instead of the test, and a compile error does not demonstrate the
   test would have caught the behaviour.

   **Confirm the mutation landed where you meant.** A scripted string-replace
   can match an identical branch elsewhere in the same file and produce a red
   result that proves nothing. Anchor on text unique to the target — the
   runner refuses to apply an anchor that does not match exactly once, which
   is the invariant hand-rolled harnesses dropped most often.

   **A compile error is not a red result.** The runner reports it as
   `COMPILE_ERROR` rather than `KILLED` for that reason; treat a mutation that
   breaks the build as a mutation that has not been run yet.

   **The `run` line is a live citation, like the anchors.** A spec applies one
   `-run` filter to every mutation below it, so a filter that has not grown a
   term as tests were added beside it evaluates those mutations against tests
   that never execute. The runner refuses a filter matching *nothing* at the
   baseline, but a filter matching five tests and missing the sixth passes
   that check — which is why a mutation that survives the filter is re-run
   package-wide and reported as `EXCLUDED`, naming the test the filter left
   out, rather than as `SURVIVED`. `EXCLUDED` is a defect in the spec, not in
   the pin: add the missing term and re-run.
3. **Apply the fix**, confirm the test now passes, and confirm the rest of the
   suite stays green.

**The pre-commit check for any `fix:` + `test:` pair:** actually revert the fix
and confirm the new test fails. Not "mentally" — that is what this said before,
and pins that passed against unfixed code shipped anyway, because the failure
modes are not visible on reading. One assertion degenerated to `0 > 0`; another
asserted on a value the code only reports after a subsequent write, so with the
input merely buffered there was nothing to observe and the check held
vacuously. If the test still passes, it is exercising the wrong branch or input
— fix the *test*, not just the code. The fix and its test belong in the same
change so this is verifiable.

Record the observed failure message in the commit body or PR. A red-green claim
without the message it produced is an assertion, not evidence.

**For de-flaking concurrency/timing tests**, the analogous proof is
`go test -race -count=N` (N ≥ 50, ideally also under `GOMAXPROCS=1`): a single
green run does not prove a flaky test is fixed, because a flaky test passes most
of the time by definition. Replace synchronization `time.Sleep` calls with a
deterministic signal (channel, `sync.WaitGroup`, or a poll-until-condition
helper); leave only genuine timing windows (mock latency, negative-observation
windows) and document each as intentional.

## Go Backend Lessons Learned

These rules are distilled from real bugs found across dozens of audit and hardening commits. **Every rule below was learned from a production-quality bug.** They must be followed for all new Go code.

### 1. Concurrency & Locking

- **Never hold a mutex during disk I/O or network calls.** Snapshot data under the lock (e.g., JSON-marshal), release the lock, then perform I/O. Holding `RLock` during `writeGzJSON` blocked the entire download pipeline for seconds. Pattern: `mu.RLock() → marshal → mu.RUnlock() → writeToDisk(marshaledBytes)`.
  `scripts/check_lock_io` enforces this mechanically (heuristic AST matching, no type information — see its doc comment) across `internal/` and `cmd/`, run as part of `scripts/run_tests.sh`. Its closure-wrapper detection (`config.Config.With`, `job.Job.ForEachUnfinishedArticle`) is an explicit allowlist by method name — adding a new lock-wrapping closure method under internal/, when the callback parameter is a literal func type or a named func type declared in the same package, requires adding it to `closureLockMethods` in `scripts/check_lock_io/main.go` (pinned by `scripts/check_lock_io/closure_enumeration_test.go`). A genuine exception (the lock also serializes something else, e.g. dial-coalescing) is suppressed with a same-line `//lockio: <reason>` comment, mirroring `//nocover:` below — see `internal/downloader/dispatch.go`'s `managedConn.Get` and `internal/postproc/verified.go`'s `MarkVerified` for two documented examples of legitimate exceptions.

- **Always use `defer mu.Unlock()`.** Manual unlock-before-return in multiple branches has caused deadlocks and double-close panics. The only exception is snapshot-then-release (above), where unlock is intentional mid-function. In that case, add a `// --- No lock held below this line ---` comment.

- **Never `delete()` from a map while holding `RLock`.** `RLock` permits concurrent readers; mutation requires a full `Lock`. This caused a `concurrent map write` panic in the WebSocket broadcaster.

- **Every `select` on a channel or semaphore must also watch the relevant context/shutdown channel.** Goroutines blocked on semaphore acquisition without watching `c.ctx.Done()` blocked forever when the connection died. Pattern:
  ```go
  select {
  case sem <- struct{}{}:
  case <-ctx.Done():
      return ctx.Err()
  case <-shutdownCh:
      return ErrShutdown
  }
  ```

- **…and any arm that can become *permanently ready* must exit the loop or disarm its channel.** The rule above is only half the requirement. This applies to receive arms on channels that can be closed — a closed channel is permanently ready, so such an arm fires on every iteration forever. It does **not** apply to ordinary work arms or to send arms: `case sem <- struct{}{}` in the pattern above neither exits nor disarms, and is correct, because a send blocks once the semaphore is full. The distinguishing question is whether the arm can stay ready without anyone doing anything. Note both `return`s in the pattern above — they are what make its closable arms safe. An arm that instead `continue`s, or falls through to the next iteration, is a full-CPU busy-spin the moment its channel closes. This is not hypothetical: it is #336, where `DisconnectAll()` broadcast by closing a channel and every `connWorker` spun until restart. Three requirements follow:
    1. **Exit or disarm.** Either leave the loop, or set the channel variable to `nil` — a nil channel blocks forever in `select`, which parks the goroutine on its remaining arms. `internal/app/pipeline.go`'s `run` is the reference: on `!ok` it sets `p.completions = nil` and continues.

       **A bare `break` inside a `select` breaks the *select*, not the loop** — it falls straight through to the next iteration and busy-spins, which is the bug this rule exists to prevent. Use `return`, or a **labelled** break (`break drain`) targeting the `for`. `internal/assembler`'s shutdown drain loop is labelled for exactly this reason. This compiles, vets, and lints clean either way, so the compiler will not catch it for you.
    2. **Receive with `, ok` from any channel that can be closed**, and act on it — loudly. Without the guard you cannot distinguish a real value from the zero value a closed channel yields forever. `internal/assembler`'s worker and `internal/app`'s `watchCompletions`/`drainCompletions` all guard this way; `drainCompletions` shows why it matters even with a `default:` arm, since a permanently-ready receive means `default` is never selected.

       Log at `Error` before exiting. A guard that returns silently swaps a loud symptom for a quiet one: #336 announced itself as 250% CPU, whereas a consumer that quietly disappears leaves jobs stalled at 100% with a clean log, which is *harder* to diagnose. And note what the guard does not buy — it protects the **receiver** only. If the senders are unguarded (they usually are), an actual `close()` panics the next send rather than exiting cleanly. The guard limits the blast radius; it does not make closing the channel safe.
    3. **The loop and the ready receive need not be in the same function.** In #336 the loop was in `connWorker` but the receive was inside `selectWork`, one call away. Reading the loop body alone will not find this class, and neither will a local AST check — `scripts/check_lock_io` descends one call level but does no return-value taint tracking, and the #336 signal flowed through a returned decision enum.

- **For an unreachable loop-exit failure, guard or delete according to who can break the invariant.** Several loops here are bounded only because something *elsewhere* never happens — a channel nobody closes, a status transition that is always legal. Both cases are unreachable today, and they take opposite treatments. The discriminator is whether the code at that point could ever detect the violation:
    - **Whole-program invariant → keep the guard, and test it.** "Nobody anywhere calls `close()` on this channel" is not provable at the receive site, and any future edit in any file can break it silently — worse, `Dispatcher.Notify()` hands its channel across a package boundary, so the invariant is not even package-local. A `, ok` guard costs one branch and is the only local defence. Close the channel in a white-box test to prove the guard turns a violation into a clean exit: the branch is unreachable in production but perfectly reachable from a test, so "unreachable" is not an excuse for leaving it uncovered. `internal/assembler` and `internal/app` each carry such a test.
    - **Locally established → the handler is dead weight, and may be worth deleting.** Where the precondition is proved a few lines up, in the same function, under a lock never released in between, nothing outside can invalidate it. A handler there guards against a caller that cannot exist, and — unlike the channel case — cannot be reached from a test either, because forcing it needs a production seam built only for the test.

      The worked example is historical — it sat in `Queue.PromoteNext`, which went with `internal/queue`, and is kept because the reasoning outlives the code: a failed `setStatusLocked(job, StatusDownloading)` leaves the job `StatusQueued`, which makes it an immediate re-candidate for `findNextQueuedCandidateLocked`, so the `continue` would have re-selected it forever. The re-check above it already proved the job was `StatusQueued`, and `TestCanTransitionStatus` pinned `Queued→Downloading` as legal, so the branch was unreachable. It was left as-is deliberately: the surrounding function was large and thinly covered, and rewriting an unreachable branch there cost more than the latent risk it removed. Weigh the same way before changing one.

  Either way, record the dependency where it is relied on, and pin it with a test where one exists. The failure mode for all of these is a silent spin rather than an error, so a broken assumption will not announce itself.

- **Don't expose mutable data to concurrent readers before it is fully initialized.** Calling `addHistory(job)` before `processJob(job)` exposed partially-initialized `StageLog` fields to API handlers reading the same struct.

- **Atomic flag ordering matters.** In `finishReader`, `closeErr` must be set *before* the `closed` atomic flag is flipped, otherwise concurrent readers see `closed=true` but read a nil error.

- **Use `sync.Once` or `CompareAndSwap` for idempotent stop/close.** Multiple stop paths (shutdown, error, cancel) can race. Using `closeOnce.Do(func(){...})` prevents double-close panics on channels and connections.

- **Guard `Start()`/`Stop()` state checks with a mutex, not bare reads.** `CancelJob` must check `started`/`stopped` under `mu.Lock` and track `inFlight` to prevent sending on a closed channel during `Stop()`.

- **Set state atomically with its observable effect.** `setBusyWithJob(true, ...)` must happen inside `popWithPause()`, not after return, to eliminate the window where `Empty()` returns true while a job is being processed.

### 2. File I/O & Persistence

- **All disk writes must be atomic: temp file → fsync → rename.** `os.WriteFile` truncates before writing; concurrent readers see partial/corrupt data. Use `os.CreateTemp` → write → `Sync()` → `Close()` → `os.Rename`. This pattern was missing in cache, queue, and dirscanner state — all required the same fix.

- **Use `os.CreateTemp` for unique temp files, never a hardcoded `.tmp` suffix.** Concurrent writes to `path + ".tmp"` corrupt state files. Dirscanner state had this bug.

- **Close the source file before `os.Remove` in cross-device move.** `defer in.Close()` runs after `os.Remove(src)`, which fails on some platforms because the file handle is still open.

- **On resume, count unfinished articles, not total articles.** `len(Articles)` includes already-downloaded parts that won't be re-dispatched, causing the assembler to hang waiting for parts that will never arrive.

- **Never delete an archive on partial extraction failure.** If only some files fail to extract from a ZIP/RAR, preserve the archive for retry or manual recovery.

- **Check directory containment before recursive delete.** `SortStage` deleted `FinalDir` when it was inside `origDir`. Always verify `!strings.HasPrefix(targetDir, sourceDir)` before removing a directory tree.

- **Path length limits are per-component (NAME_MAX = 255 bytes), not per-path.** This is Linux-only software; do not import Windows MAX_PATH heuristics. When sanitizing folder + filename pairs, make the folder name a function of the job alone — never derive folder truncation from the filename, or files in the same job will scatter across multiple directories.

### 3. Shutdown & Lifecycle Ordering

- **Shutdown order: stop producers → checkpoint → drain consumers → cancel context → wait → cleanup.** The correct order is: (1) Stop downloader (no new articles), (2) Run the clean-shutdown durability barrier and abort active DirectUnpackers, (3) Stop assembler (drains in-flight writes, delivers completions), (4) Cancel context (watchCompletions exits), (5) Wait for goroutines, (6) Stop post-processor, flush cache, save queue. `Application.Shutdown` and `stopWorkers` implement exactly this; their doc comments are the authority.

  Step (2) is not optional and its **position** is the whole of it. The barrier has to sit after the downloader stops and before the assembler does, because that is the only window where both halves hold: no new article can arrive, and the file handles the barrier needs still exist. Run it earlier and whatever arrives in between is never acked; run it later and there is nothing open to fsync. Omitting it entirely re-fetches everything downloaded since the last checkpoint on the next start — a full checkpoint window thrown away on every deliberate restart, which is the cost a crash is *supposed* to pay and a clean stop is not. See `internal/app/app.go`'s `stopWorkers` and `Application.shutdownCheckpoint`, and `docs/durability-contract.md` § *The checkpoint cadence*.

  Getting the rest of the order wrong drops file completion events.

- **Fallback goroutines spawned for channel delivery must watch `ctx.Done()`.** A `go func() { ch <- val }()` goroutine leaks forever if the receiver has exited. Always add a `case <-ctx.Done()` branch.

- **Don't penalize servers on `context.Canceled`.** Pause and shutdown cancel contexts, which is not a server error. Check `ctx.Err()` before calling `RecordBadConnection` or `ApplyPenalty`.

- **Clean up orphaned resources on startup.** Crash-orphaned temp files, stale lock files, and incomplete downloads accumulate across restarts. `Prune()` must clean these up.

### 4. HTTP API & Security

- **Extract `mode` and `apikey` from query params first, form body second.** For routing (`mode=`) and authentication (`apikey=`/`nzbkey=`), always check `r.URL.Query()` first. For POST requests, fall back to the form body using `formValue()` (which respects `MaxBytesReader`). This supports third-party apps (Sonarr, Radarr, NZB360) that send parameters as form fields. Never use `r.FormValue()` directly in routing/auth — it triggers implicit `ParseMultipartForm` with Go's default 32MiB limit.

- **Always apply `http.MaxBytesReader` in middleware, not in individual handlers.** Create the `statusWriter` before `MaxBytesReader` so 413 responses are logged correctly. Use `maxUploadBytes` for `multipart/form-data`, `maxFormBytes` for everything else.

- **CSRF protection requires *both* `Origin` and `Sec-Fetch-Site` checks.** Cross-origin GET requests (via `<img>` or `<form method=GET>`) don't send an `Origin` header. Modern browsers send `Sec-Fetch-Site` instead. Block requests with `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` or `cross-origin`.

- **Cookie-based auth on local-network services needs Referer/Origin validation.** Even `localhost` APIs are vulnerable to CSRF if the browser sends cookies automatically.

- **Cap all query `limit` parameters.** `limit=0` or `limit=999999999` loads unbounded data into memory. Enforce `defaultLimit` and `maxLimit` constants on all list/search endpoints.

- **Never use `os.ExpandEnv` on raw config file bytes.** It leaks host environment variables into config values. Expand only explicitly marked fields.

### 5. Resource Management

- **Systematic File Handle Leak Prevention (Tracking-Slice & Control-Message Patterns).** Because standard static analysis cannot reliably track file descriptors across asynchronous goroutine boundaries or channels, all file handling MUST follow two architectural patterns:
  - **Synchronous & Loop Scopes (The Tracking-Slice Pattern):** When opening files within a loop or function (e.g., archive volume discovery or batch processing), never rely on downstream readers or end-of-function statements to close them on early return/error paths. Always accumulate opened handles in a slice with a deferred cleanup block immediately after discovery:
    ```go
    var opened []io.ReadCloser
    defer func() {
        for _, f := range opened {
            _ = f.Close() // Best-effort close on completion, early return, or error
        }
    }()
    ```
  - **State-Machine Scopes (The Control-Message Pattern):** When an engine holds file descriptors open across asynchronous requests (e.g., `assembler.open`), handles must be owned by a *single* worker goroutine. Every state machine lifecycle transition out of active assembly (e.g., completion entering post-processing via `maybeFinalize`, job cancellation, or job failure) MUST invoke a synchronous control message (`CloseJobHandles`, `CancelJob`) that blocks until the worker goroutine explicitly closes and flushes all open file descriptors before subsequent pipeline stages run.

- **Network Filesystem (NFS/SMB) Silly-Rename Deletion Protocol.** On NFS shares, unlinking an open file renames it to a hidden `.nfsXXXX` file instead of removing it, causing subsequent directory removal (`os.RemoveAll`) to fail with `EBUSY` or `ENOTEMPTY`. Never use raw `os.RemoveAll` or `os.Remove` on job output directories, cleanup paths, or temp directories. Always use `fsutil.RemoveAll`, `fsutil.Remove`, or `fsutil.RemoveRootAll`, which implement exponential backoff retries and non-fatal warning detection for lingering silly-rename files.

- **Track and close file descriptors for cancelled jobs.** The assembler holds open file handles per job. When a job is cancelled, `CancelJob` must close all associated FDs via a control message to the worker goroutine, or FDs leak indefinitely.

- **Use tombstone sets to reject late/duplicate messages.** After a file is completed and closed, late duplicate articles can re-open it, leaking FDs. Maintain a `completedFiles` set to reject them.

- **Add idle read deadlines on long-lived network sockets.** NNTP connections without read deadlines hang silently when the remote end disappears. Use `SetReadDeadline` and reset on each successful read.

- **SQLite per-connection pragmas belong in the DSN, not in post-connect hooks.** `journal_mode=WAL` and `busy_timeout` set via `_pragma=` in the DSN ensure every connection (including pool-created ones) has them from the start.

- **Batch large deletions to avoid unbounded transactions.** Deleting thousands of history records in a single `DELETE ... WHERE id IN (...)` can lock the database. Use chunked deletes with a reasonable batch size.

### 6. Code Complexity & Hotspot Refactoring

These rules are established from real hotspots targeted by repowise. They ensure cyclomatic complexity remains low, allowing standard linter checks and manual reviews to succeed easily.

- **Simplify Multi-Strategy Fallbacks**: When a method implements multiple fallback, validation, or conditional path strategies (like CSRF `isCrossOrigin` or complex auth logic), extract each strategy into its own focused helper (e.g. `isRefererCrossOrigin`). This drops the parent method's cyclomatic complexity (CCN) and enables targeted, isolated testing.

- **Consolidate Subsystem Boilerplates**: Avoid duplicating decoder setups, channel progress monitoring goroutines, and panic recovery setups across adjacent methods (like `GoVerify` and `GoRepair`). Consolidate these into unified helper methods (e.g. `newDecoderForDir`, `monitorProgress`). This ensures setup bug-fixes propagate globally.

- **Isolate Parsing & Normalization**: Keep primary decoding handlers (like config `decode`) concise. Extract error-type partitioning loops (like parsing `yaml.TypeError`) and struct normalizations (like assigning defaults or converting nil slices) into dedicated helpers.

- **Measure the result; preserve behavior exactly**: After a complexity-reduction extraction, run `gocyclo`/`gocognit` on the function and use the *measured* number — never an estimate — in any commit claim. Confirm the extraction is behavior-preserving: when hoisting shared statements out of sibling branches (e.g. `ParError = true`), verify every branch set them; when converting fall-through into return values, re-run `golangci-lint` (it may now flag `S1008`/`ifElseChain` that the original control flow hid).

### 7. Performance & Hot-Path Discipline

These rules were learned from production pprof profiling at 2 Gbps. The download pipeline processes ~330 articles/second; any per-article overhead multiplies fast.

#### Dispatch Loop (`internal/downloader/dispatch.go`)

- **Never iterate all articles to find pending work.** `Job.ForEachUnfinishedArticle` (`internal/job/content.go`) uses the per-file `FileProgress.Pending` counters and `JobProgress.pendingArticles` to skip completed files and jobs in O(1). (Neither lives on `JobFile` or `Job`: `JobFile` is NZB-parse scaffolding with no counters, and the job-level figure is reached through `JobProgress.PendingArticles()`.) Any new code that walks articles must respect these counters — do not introduce new linear scans over the article slice.

- **Maintain pending counters on every state mutation.** When setting an article's done/emitted/failed bit, you **must** keep `FileProgress.Pending` and `JobProgress.pendingArticles` in step. The pattern: decrement when an article leaves the pending state (Emitted, Done, or Failed for the first time); increment when it returns. If a bulk operation makes incremental tracking fragile, call `JobProgress.recompute(m)` instead. See `markEmitted`, `markDone`, `markFailed` and `Job.ClearEmittedForReload` for canonical examples. The single-article and batch mark helpers the assembler used to call are gone. Article resolution reaches the job through `AckDurable` (which takes a `durability.DurableProof`) and `Job.MarkArticleFailed` — and also through `SeedFromRuns` and `ReplaceFromRuns`, which reach `markDone` with no proof and no barrier. That is deliberate: their evidence is the durable runs a barrier's fsync already recorded, re-read at startup, which a proof cannot express. Do not read "resolution enters only through `AckDurable`" as an invariant — it is true of the download path and false of the resume path. See `docs/durability-contract.md` §1.

- **Cache per-server data once per dispatch pass, not per article.** `srv.Cfg()` returns a by-value struct copy. Calling it per-article per-server cost 0.69s in production profiles. The `serverCfgs []config.ServerConfig` slice in `dispatchPass` caches these. Any new per-server state queries (e.g., `Active()`, penalty checks) should follow the same pattern: snapshot once, pass the slice to `tryDispatch`.

- **Use 2-case selects (send/default), not 3-case (send/default/ctx.Done).** `runtime.selectgo` is significantly cheaper with 2 cases. Check `ctx.Err()` once before the server loop instead.

- **Defer heap allocations past early-exit checks.** `articleRequest` is allocated only after confirming the article is not already in-flight. Moving the alloc before the `inFlight` check wasted 1.9s/10s on objects immediately discarded.

#### Decoder (`internal/decoder/decoder.go`)

- **Use the LUT for `indexSpecial`, not `bytes.IndexAny`.** The 256-byte lookup table `specialLUT` identifies CR, LF, and `=` bytes in O(1) per byte. `bytes.IndexAny` performed O(N×M) string scanning and was the #1 decoder bottleneck. Do not replace the LUT with standard library functions.

- **`sub42Span` fuses copy + subtract into one pass.** The yEnc subtract-42 operation and the output append are combined into a single unrolled scalar loop for L1 cache efficiency. Do not split this back into `copy` + loop, and do not add bounds checks inside the inner loop (the capacity pre-check at the top ensures safety).

- **The LUT must be a compile-time constant array, not built in `init()`.** `init()` functions are forbidden by project convention, and the LUT values are known at compile time.

#### NNTP I/O (`internal/nntp/io.go`)

- **Pre-size `readDotStuffedBody`'s buffer to 768 KB.** Without this, `bytes.Buffer` grows incrementally, causing `memclrNoHeapPointers` (4.1%) and `memmove` (2.6%) to dominate the profile. The 768 KB value matches a typical yEnc article (~750 KB payload).

#### Job records (`internal/job/`)

- **Address an article by its global index, never by message-ID.** Every mutation entry point carries indices rather than IDs, in the shape that suits it: `Job.MarkArticleEmitted` and `Job.ClearArticleEmitted` take a single `artIdx int`, `Job.MarkArticleFailed` takes a single `artIdx int`, and `Job.AckDurable` takes a `durability.DurableProof` whose `Articles()` payload carries them. Every production caller already holds an index. There is deliberately no by-ID lookup structure to reach for: one existed as a lazily-built `map[string]int` per resident job, and was deleted once the last caller stopped needing it. If job code seems to need to resolve a message-ID, the index is available further up the call stack — pass it down rather than reintroducing the map.

- **A global article index maps to its file through `Manifest.fileIndexForArticle`.** That is what lets a mutation update per-file `Pending` without scanning for the parent file. It is derived from the manifest's file ranges, never persisted separately.

- **All transient fields (`Pending`, `pendingArticles`, `emitted`) are excluded from the persisted shape.** They are recomputed by `JobProgress.recompute(m)` on load, and `emitted` is excluded from persistence so a restart starts with an empty emitted bitset by default; `Job.ClearEmittedForReload` is called exclusively during `ReloadDownloader` to re-arm in-flight articles — `git grep -n 'j\.ClearEmittedForReload(' -- '*.go' ':!*_test.go'` finds 1 line, `internal/app/reloader.go:257`, inside `ReloadDownloader`. If you add new transient state, follow this pattern and ensure it is initialized on both paths that produce a `(manifest, progress)` pair — which is where the transient fields live, not `Dispatcher`: `Job.AttachContent` builds a fresh `JobProgress` via `newJobProgress(m)`, and `Job.RestoreContent` takes a decoded one and calls `p.recompute(m)`. Both are reached from `appResidency.Hydrate` (`internal/app/residency.go`), and neither is reachable from `internal/dispatch`, which handles `*job.Job` values without access to their unexported progress fields.

- **`Job.ClearEmittedForReload` is the self-healing reset, but only when it has something to reset.** It walks the manifest through `JobProgress.resetForReload`, and calls `JobProgress.recompute(m)` — rebuilding all counters from ground truth — *only if* it cleared or retained at least one article (`if len(cleared) > 0 || len(retained) > 0`, `internal/job/content.go`). A job with nothing emitted and nothing failed skips `recompute` entirely, so this is not an unconditional counter repair: if you suspect drift during development, call `recompute(m)` rather than assuming this path reached it.

#### General Performance Rules

- **Profile before optimizing.** Use `go tool pprof` with production workloads. Synthetic benchmarks miss real bottlenecks (e.g., `selectgo` overhead only appears under multi-server dispatch contention).

- **String map keys for message-IDs are expensive.** NNTP message-IDs are long strings (40-80 bytes); `aeshashbody` for these keys costs 1.15s/10s at 2 Gbps. Avoid adding new `map[string]` lookups in the per-article hot path. If you must, consider integer keys or pre-hashed values.

- **A discarded log call still allocates, once per argument the compiler cannot box statically.** `Logger.Debug` checks the level *inside* the call, but the variadic `...any` arguments are boxed at the **call site**, before it is entered — so filtering by level does not avoid the cost. Measured against a `slog.TextHandler` set to `Info`, so every call below emits nothing:

  | Call | ns/op | B/op | allocs/op |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `Debug("msg")` | 3.8 | 0 | 0 |
  | `Debug("msg", "k1", "c1", "k2", "c2", "k3", "c3")` — all constants | 5.4 | 0 | **0** |
  | `Debug("msg", "k1", strVar)` | 15.3 | 16 | **1** |
  | `Debug("msg", "server", s, "worker", w, "reason", r)` | 38.8 | 48 | **3** |
  | `Debug("msg", "k1", intVar)`, `0 <= v <= 255` | 4.6 | 0 | 0 |
  | `Debug("msg", "k1", intVar)`, larger | 9.9 | 8 | 1 |
  | guarded by `log.Enabled(ctx, slog.LevelDebug)` | 2.6 | 0 | 0 |
  | `LogAttrs(ctx, ..., slog.String(...)×3)` | 14.9 | 0 | 0 |

  Constant keys and values box into read-only statics, and ints in `[0,255]` hit `runtime.staticuint64s` — which is why some non-constant arguments still cost nothing. `slog.Attr` carries its value without boxing, so `LogAttrs` is allocation-free. To re-measure after a Go upgrade, benchmark the call shapes above against a package-level `slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(io.Discard, &slog.HandlerOptions{Level: slog.LevelInfo}))` with package-level `var` arguments, so the compiler cannot fold them into constants. **This is not a reason to delete log calls.** In a bounded path — per article, per file, per job — the cost is noise against the payloads, and the diagnostic value is worth far more than 39 ns. It matters only inside a loop with no natural bound, and there the *loop* is the defect. Treat a high allocation rate with a flat `HeapAlloc` as a **diagnostic signal** that you have an unbounded loop: that is how #336 was found, since a spin that allocates is visible in `/debug/vars` while a silent one is not. If a hot but genuinely bounded path needs the call, guard it with `Enabled()` or use `LogAttrs`.

- **`sync.Pool` is usually not worth it in this codebase.** The `articleRequest` allocation (0.3s at steady-state) is small enough that pool overhead (Put/Get synchronization) would offset the savings. Only pool objects that are large and allocated at >10K/sec.
