// TestDrainFailure_ReportsEveryRolledBackArticle pins the path where the
// BARRIER routes the fault and this package still owes the articles.
//
// A failed Drain rolls back everything after the write that failed, and that
// set never crosses the SyncTarget interface — the barrier gets an error and a
// list of what DID land, and nothing else. So the articles were left neither
// Done, nor Failed, nor Outstanding: their Emitted bits stayed set,
// ForEachUnfinishedArticle skipped them, and only a restart
// recovered them.
//
// The counts matter as much as the routing. partsWritten is incremented on
// ACCEPT, so a rolled-back article leaves the file one part closer to
// TotalParts with nothing behind it, and a later article can take it to
// completion — firing OnFileComplete over bytes that never reached WriteAt,
// with failedBytes unchanged, so the job reports 100% health.
