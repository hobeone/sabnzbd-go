	//
	// It carries NO article index, and that separation is the fix for a whole
	// class of stranding. The signature used to name one article, so a batch
	// failure — a coalesced run, a drain, a cache displacement — could report

	// combinations, not because the split is tidier. A fault this package
	// routes itself needs both; a Drain or Sync failure reaches the barrier,
	// which routes the fault — but the article set never leaves this package,
	// so it still needs this one. Folding them together meant either
	// double-routing the fault or losing the articles, and losing the
	// articles is what happened.
	//
	// Emitted is NOT Outstanding: ForEachUnfinishedArticle skips a set Emitted
	// bit, so an article reported by neither is stranded for the life of the
	// process — not Done, not Failed, not Outstanding — until something clears
	// the bit. Two things do, and neither is on this path:
	//
	//   - A restart, by NOT persisting the bit rather than by clearing it.
	//     jobProgressJSON excludes emitted deliberately
	//     (internal/job/progress.go), so a job reloaded from the store starts
	//     with none set. Nothing has to run for this to hold.
	//   - A downloader reload, which calls Job.ClearEmittedForReload(false)
	//     per job and clears them in-process — unless the job is one whose
	//     checkpoint could not protect it, in which case #417 withholds
	//     exactly this clear.
	//
	// So "stranded until the process stops" is the worst case, not the only
	// one: a reload in between recovers it, and a withheld reload does not.
	//

	// failed and must not be read as evidence about any article (A1).

	// article. Routing a rejection through OnWriteFault would stall the job on
	// a healthy disk; routing a disk fault through here would record a
	// perfectly good article as damaged.
	//
	// The article is permanently failed from this package's point of view —
	// the offset comes from the server and a re-fetch yields the same one —
	// so the caller records it with Job.MarkArticleFailed. That is what
	// charges its bytes against the job's par2 recovery budget and releases
	// on-demand recovery volumes. Without it the article stays Emitted, which

// They are not acked — this package has no ack authority — and no later Drain
// reports them either, because Close throws the writer away and its retained
// report with it.
//
// It is worth being exact about which step does that, because this comment
// used to name the wrong one: it said "the Sync that follows is what discards
// a confirmed one". FileWriter.Sync discards nothing, and says so in its own
// doc — Confirm releases the report, and drainAndClose never calls Confirm. So
// a reader tracing "who acks these?" was sent looking for a Sync-side discard
// that does not exist. It is Close.
//
// Their Emitted bits therefore stay set, which is NOT the same as Outstanding
// — an earlier version of this doc said "left Outstanding and re-fetched (S3)"
// and that was only ever true of the worker-exit caller, where the next start
// begins with them clear because emitted is never persisted. On the
// CloseJobHandles path the process keeps running, and nothing resets them
// until it stops or a downloader reload clears them in-process.
//
// That costs nothing in the ordinary case. A clean stop runs
// Application.shutdownCheckpoint — a full barrier, ack included — while the
// downloader is already stopped and the handles still exist, so by the time
// this runs there is little left to report.
//
// # What happens to the articles the drain ROLLED BACK, which is the fix here
//
// A failed Drain rolls back everything after the failing write into w.faulted,
// and takeFaulted is its only consumer. Without the releaseFaulted below that
// set died with the writer, and those articles kept their Emitted bits: not
// Done, not Failed, not Outstanding.
//
// They no longer keep their place in partsWritten as well — FileWriter.fail
// gives the part back as it rolls the article back — so what is lost by
// skipping the release is the routing alone. That is still the half that
// strands an article for the life of the process.
//
// # Why the fault is REPORTED and not ROUTED
//
// Returning it is the pattern opDrain, opSync and opTruncate already use, and
// the reason to prefer it here is not symmetry. Routing a fault out-of-band
// from this function was tried and is wrong three ways:
//
//   - It bypasses durability.ErrFaultRouted. Barrier.raise mints that marker so
//     the application layer does not park a job twice for one condition; a
//     fault built here carries no marker and reaches Stallable directly, so a
//     wedged mount that already stalled the job through the barrier's own Drain
//     stalls it again when the same file is closed.
//   - On the CloseJobHandles path the job is already StatusVerifying, which is
//     a phase neither Stall nor Fail can act on: Verifying → Paused is not a
//     legal status edge, and maybeFinalize is a no-op once PostProc is set.
//   - On the opClose path the barrier has already drained, synced, truncated,
//     committed the runs and acked the articles. A fault from the redundant
//     second fsync would race the completion it is part of.
//
// A permanent fault is preferred over the first one when they differ, because
// only the permanent one preserves R20. ENOSPC on the drain followed by EROFS
// on the close — an ext4 mounted errors=remount-ro, the Debian default — is
// the case that makes the difference: reporting the ENOSPC alone describes the
// condition as one that waiting can clear, when it cannot.

//
//   - It calls releaseFaulted and routes whatever Close returns, firing
//     OnArticlesUnwritten and OnArticleRejected. This path DROPS that set. The
//     job is being torn down and has already left the queue, so returning its
//     articles to Outstanding would re-dispatch work for a job that is going
//     away — true under both dispositions, since keeping a job's bytes does
//     not make its articles wanted again. closeleak_test.go pins it with
//     t.Errorf on both callbacks, for each disposition.
//   - It calls Sync. CloseJobHandles needs that fsync because par2 and unrar
//     are about to read the file. Nothing reads a removed job's files, and an
//     fsync here would stall ingest for every other job on the one worker
//     goroutine in exchange for nothing.
//
// "Already left the queue" is exact rather than hedging: RemoveJob is the only
// production caller of CancelJob — `git grep -n 'CancelJob(' -- '*.go'`
// outside tests and outside this file's own doc comments returns
// Application.RemoveJob alone — and since #376 it removes the job from the

//
// # The article that is owed something
//
// An article can reach here holding no state at all: absent from seenDone,
// absent from seenFailed, and holding no part. FileWriter.fail puts it in
// exactly that condition — it clears the seenDone entry and gives the part
// back together — for every article a coalesced run or a drain rolled back.
// The rollback returned it to Outstanding, the downloader re-dispatched it,
// and the copy that comes back arrives after its file was tombstoned.
//
// A cache displacement no longer reaches that condition. failDisplaced counts
// the article and records it in seenFailed (#386), so a redelivery of one is
// recognised below rather than falling through to the rejection arm and being
// reported permanently failed a second time.
//
// An earlier version of this paragraph derived the same conclusion from
// "partsWritten is incremented when an article is ACCEPTED and is never
// decremented". That premise was already false when it was written — the
// give-back existed, in releaseFaulted — and it is comprehensively false now.
// The conclusion survives the correction because it never depended on the
// count: what strands the article is the absence of a RECORD, not the presence
// of a part.
//
// Dropping that one strands it: not written, not acked, not failed, and
// Emitted again from the re-dispatch — which ForEachUnfinishedArticle skips,
// so nothing re-dispatches it a second time and the job never finishes.
//
// It is reported as rejected, which resolves it as permanently failed. That is
// the honest disposition rather than a convenient one: the file is finished,
// its content is whatever the barrier recorded, and this package cannot write
// the article now or later. Returning it to Outstanding instead would have it
// re-dispatched into the same tombstone forever. Failing it charges its bytes
// against the job's par2 recovery budget, which is exactly the decision par2
// exists to make.
//
// The distinction is drawn on seenDone, so it is only ever made when the
// answer is positively known. An article the writer accepted is dropped
// silently, as before — failing it would charge good bytes against recovery
// and degrade the job's reported health. Since #386 that set also contains
// articles which were accepted and then displaced: they keep their seenDone
// entry alongside a seenFailed one, so they are dropped here on the first
// test rather than the second. The disposition is the same either way — this
// package cannot write them now — but the reason is no longer only "accepted".
// When the writer is gone there is nothing to consult, and dropping is the

// finalizeFile records that a file's parts have all arrived and reports it.

// durable runs reach, which spans what earlier processes wrote and this one
// never saw, and the whole-file CRC is the crc32 of a file's single run. Doing
// either here would be this package asserting something about bytes on disk
// that it cannot check — the shape behind #342, #349 and #350.
//
// It no longer CLOSES the file either, and that is the load-bearing part. The
// barrier's FinalizeFile must Drain, Sync, Truncate and Stat this file, and
// every one of those goes through the handle this package owns. Closing here
// would leave the completed file untrimmed — pre-allocation's trailing zeros
// intact, which par2 reports as damage — and would discard the last drain's
// Written articles with nothing to ack them, so they would be re-fetched on
// every restart forever.
//
// So the handle stays open and the file stays in `open` until the caller asks
// for it back via CloseFile, which the completion consumer calls after the
// barrier has finalized the file. The tombstone below is set NOW rather than at
// close, so a late duplicate is rejected during that window instead of being
// written into a file the barrier is finalizing.
//
// The cost is file descriptors, and it is worth stating the bound accurately
// because the obvious one is wrong. A completed file holds its handle until the
// completion consumer works through to it. That consumer is serial and its
// event channel is bounded — but the channel is not the bound: the producer
// side spawns a goroutine per event when the channel is full, precisely so the
// worker here never blocks on a consumer that may need the worker. So the real
// bound is the number of files an active job can complete before the consumer
// catches up, which in the limit is every file of every active job.
//
// That is the same ORDER as the pre-existing worst case — a job's files are
// largely open at once while they are being written, since the dispatcher fans
// out across them — but it now persists past completion rather than ending at
// it, and it grows when finalization is slow (a barrier per file) rather than
// when writing is.
//
// Blocking here instead is not available: OnFileComplete runs on the worker,
// and the consumer's finalize path submits control messages back to this same
// worker, so making the worker wait for the consumer deadlocks both.
//
// Every path that can abandon the handoff (CancelJob, CloseJobHandles, worker
