// FileWriter owns one target file: its handle, its share of the write cache,
// its coalescing, and its pre-allocation. It has no authority over anything
// externally visible.
//
// It cannot ack an article, record a CRC part, decide a file is complete, or
// truncate. Those decisions moved to durability.Barrier, which is the only
// component that knows whether an fsync has happened. The writer's entire
// contract to the outside world is: bytes it reports from Drain reached
// WriteAt without error, and everything else is its own business.
//
// This continues the direction #358 started rather than reversing it. That
// change moved the ack from accept to WriteAt — Decoded to Written. This one
// moves it from Written to Durable, which is the step #358 explicitly declined
// ("this does not defer acks to fsync — that would push every ack to file
// completion"). That objection was correct at the time: Sync ran only in
// finalizeFile, so acking after fsync really did mean acking at file
// completion. The barrier removes the premise by fsyncing on a cadence, so
// the cost is one checkpoint interval rather than a whole file.
//
// Single-goroutine, no locking, like everything else the assembler worker
// owns (X1). The barrier reaches it through the worker's control-message
// channel, never directly — see syncTarget.

	// wc is the assembler-wide write cache, and fb is this file's entry in

	// with it because the memory bound in B2 is global across files, not
	// per-file — forceFlushLargest has to compare files against each other,
	// and the coalescing scratch buffer is reused across all of them. A
	// per-writer cache would make the bound per-file and multiply the scratch
	// allocation by the number of open files.

	// written accumulates the articles whose bytes reached WriteAt without
	// error and have not yet been reported by a Drain. It is the ONLY evidence
	// the barrier has, so nothing may be appended here that has not come back
	// from a successful writeAt (S2).
	written []durability.WrittenArticle

	// reported holds what a Drain has already handed to the barrier but whose
	// CYCLE has not been confirmed. Drain returns it again, and Confirm — not
	// Sync — is what finally discards it.
	//
	// The distinction is the whole point. A successful fsync makes the bytes
	// durable, but the barrier still has to commit the run rows and ack the
	// articles, and both can fail after it. Releasing on the
	// fsync covered only the first of the failures this retention exists for,
	// while the doc below claimed all three.
	//
	// This is R12's at-least-once delivery, which SyncTarget.Drain explicitly
	// blesses ("re-reporting an article a previous Drain already returned is
	// permitted and expected"), and it is load-bearing rather than tidy. A
	// barrier that drains and then fails — the sync, the run commit, the
	// truncate — used to lose the report outright. For a file still being
	// written that only cost a re-fetch. For a COMPLETED file it costs bytes:
	// the retry drains nothing, so the bound FinalizeFile trims to
	// sits below bytes that are genuinely on disk, and the truncate destroys
	// them. That is the #342/#350 family arriving through the recovery path.
	//
	// An earlier version of this comment argued the opposite — that retaining
	// the report would "trade a bounded cost for an unbounded slice". The
	// bound it was worried about is real but small: entries accumulate only
	// between CONFIRMED cycles, and a job whose barriers are failing stalls
	// (R19) and stops writing.

	// seenDone and seenFailed keep duplicate handling idempotent (R12). They
	// moved here from openFile because the writer owns the cache the first
	// copy may still be sitting in.
	//
	// Both are keyed on ArtIdx, the article's manifest index, rather than its
	// Message-ID. ArtIdx has no value that doubles as "absent" — an NZB may
	// omit the Message-ID, but never the index — so every article has a key
	// these maps can hold, and there is no empty-key class to guard against.
	//
	// Both are membership-only. seenDone used to carry the offset the article
	// was accepted at, and this comment said the duplicate branch needed it in
	// order to ask wc.buffered whether the first copy had left the cache. It
	// never asked: handleSuccessArticle's duplicate arm releases the buffer
	// and returns, because the answer does not change what it does — either
	// way the second copy's bytes are redundant and re-writing them would be a
	// second WriteAt over the same range. The offset was written and never
	// read.

	// acceptedAt records which article OWNS each offset this writer has
	// accepted bytes for. It is the collision detector (#383).
	//
	// Detection used to live in writeCache.buffer, which decided a collision
	// by finding the first article still resident in fb.articles. That answers
	// "are these bytes still unwritten", which is a question about caching,
	// not about what the file has been told. buildContiguousRun deletes each
	// article it flushes and advances fb.writeCursor past it, so for an
	// IN-ORDER download the first article was gone before the duplicate
	// arrived: the duplicate was buffered, never picked up by a run, and
	// written over the first at drain time. No detection, no roll-back, both
	// counted, file completes. Two further paths missed it — caching disabled
	// (write_cache_size has no validation floor and accepts zero) and
	// zero-length articles, which buffer refuses. Both route to writeOne.
	//
	// A collision is decided by IDENTITY, not by occupancy: an offset already
	// owned by THIS article is a re-accept, not a collision. That is what
	// makes the index safe without any removal.
	//
	// The index answers TWO questions, and they resolve opposite ways. Whether
	// the owner has been reported Written decides which article loses:
	// offsetSettledBy refuses the ARRIVAL when it has, because the incumbent's
	// bytes already back a durable claim; Accept displaces the INCUMBENT when
	// it has not, because a buffered article contradicts nothing. Only the
	// second reaches failDisplaced, and acceptArticle has already refused
	// everything the first covers before Accept is called.
	//
	// The occupancy form would have needed it. An article whose write faults
	// is rolled back and re-dispatched, and comes back at the same offset —
	// req.ArtIdx is the manifest index, so the redelivered articleID is
	// identical — and without removal every such retry would report a
	// collision with itself. Removal used to be additionally blocked for one
	// class of article: fail returned early on an empty Message-ID, so an
	// untracked article's entry would never have been removed, which was that
	// false positive arriving on the one path the mechanism could not reach.
	// fail no longer has that early return, but removal still is not how
	// acceptedAt behaves — see below, entries are never removed by design,
	// independent of what fail does. Identity comparison answers all of it and
	// leaves seenDone alone.
	//
	// Entries are never removed, and that is deliberate rather than a leak.
	// The question is "who owns this offset", not "who currently holds a
	// part", so the index is intentionally NOT equal to seenDone: a
	// write-faulted article keeps its entry here while losing its seenDone
	// one. Residency is the writer's, so this is per-open-episode — a
	// collision spanning a close-handles cycle or a restart is invisible,
	// exactly as seenDone's duplicate handling is.

// write-faulted article keeps its offset ownership after fail has taken its
// part and its seenDone entry away, and a later arrival at that offset
// displaces a stale owner holding nothing. failPermanent would count nothing
// for it and the file would wedge exactly as before. admitPermanentFailure
// counts if and only if the article is not already counted.
//
// It also leaves the seenDone entry in place, and both duplicate-handling
// readers — handleSuccessArticle and handleLateDuplicate — test seenDone
// before seenFailed, so a redelivery of the loser takes the duplicate arm
// rather than being re-written and displacing the winner in turn.
// admitPermanentFailure itself reads the two in the opposite order, which is
// how it tells an already-counted article from a new one.
//
// # Precondition: the incumbent must not have been reported Written
//
// This is only correct for an article that made no durability claim. One that
// reached noteWritten is in w.written, or in w.reported after a Drain, or
// already acked and gone from both after a Confirm — and in every one of those
// the barrier will record it. Rolling it back here as well gives one article
// two terminal dispositions, and lets the displacer overwrite bytes a run
// records the incumbent's CRC over, so the record describes a range the file
// no longer holds.
//
// acceptArticle enforces the precondition by refusing the ARRIVAL when the
// offset is settled, so this is reached only from the cache-eviction case it
// was written for. Do not add a caller without checking offsetSettledBy first.
// It does NOT delegate to fail. It used to, and then reached back to

// record after it was built, by a call site that had to find it again — and it
// carried a live defect. fail returned early on an empty Message-ID at the
// time, so for an untracked article nothing was appended, the positional
// guard matched nothing, and the whole displacement was dropped: no report,
// and nothing resolved the article in either direction. (That early return is
// gone now — see fail's doc — but the reason failDisplaced still does not
// delegate to it is independent: fail rolls a part back, and a displaced
// article keeps its part, so delegating would decrement the wrong way
// regardless of identity.) Keeping its part is now the correct outcome and no

// makes routeFaulted report it at all, without which it stayed Emitted

// re-reports everything a Drain has already handed over but no Sync has yet
// confirmed, which is R12's at-least-once delivery. Reading "since the last
// call" as the contract makes the re-report look redundant, and removing it
// destroys bytes on a retried finalize: the retry drains nothing, so the
// bound FinalizeFile trims to sits below bytes genuinely on disk. See
// take() and the FileWriter.reported field doc, which are the authority.
//
// It must NOT return an article that is merely buffered. S2 makes acceptance
// and durability different things, and this return value is the only evidence
// the barrier has — returning a buffered article here is defect #355
// relocated: the barrier would fsync bytes that are not in the file and ack an
// article that is not on disk.
//
// On the first write failure it returns the articles that DID land plus the
// classified fault, so the barrier can see both what it may claim and why the
// drain stopped. It stops rather than continuing, because a storage fault is
// a condition of the device and the next write is overwhelmingly likely to hit
// it too.
//
// # Why there is no context here
//
// There was one, and it guarded the entry with ctx.Err(). Nothing could reach
// the guard: every caller is the assembler's worker goroutine, which had no
// context to pass and supplied context.Background().
//
// Wiring the real one through was the other repair and it is the wrong one.
// The barrier treats an error this returns as a storage condition unless it
// names itself otherwise — a *storagefault.Fault, ErrFileNotOpen or
// ErrTargetUnavailable — and anything else is classified and routed to
// Stallable. A cancelled context is none of those, so it would park a healthy
// job on a device fault that does not exist. That is the A1 conflation the rest
// of this package works to avoid, arriving through a guard that looks like
// caution. See durability.ErrTargetUnavailable for the boundary rule.
//
// Nothing is left unbounded by removing it. The operation is bounded at the
// submit side by barrierOpTimeout, which is where a caller that has given up
// stops waiting; and once the op reaches the worker there is nothing to
// abandon it for, since the worker owns the handle and a half-finished drain

// # Why the set is a return value

// Close is the writer's last act: everything it holds is unreachable

// nor Failed, nor Outstanding — its Emitted bit is still set from dispatch and
// ForEachUnfinishedArticle skips a set Emitted bit — so it is stranded for the
// life of the process unless something clears that bit. A restart clears it by
// not persisting it — jobProgressJSON excludes emitted deliberately
// (internal/job/progress.go) — and a downloader reload clears it in-process,
// unless #417 withholds that job's clear.
//
// There are two call sites — `grep -n 'w\.Close()' internal/assembler/*.go |
// grep -v _test.go` returns the cancel arm and drainAndClose — and the set is
// empty at both whenever every producer of w.faulted has been drained before
// the worker returns to its select loop, which is the ordinary case.
//
// One path leaves it non-empty on purpose. The cancel arm's KeepFiles branch
// calls Drain, whose error path calls w.fail on everything it did not attempt,
// and then deliberately skips the releaseFaulted that would empty the set
// again — because routing those articles would re-dispatch work for a job
// that has left the queue. So a non-empty set there is expected rather than a
// defect, and that arm distinguishes the two cases by whether the drain
// failed.
//
// This return value does not fix a leak. It converts the emptiness from a
// property that has to be re-argued across the whole file into one the
// compiler restates at each call site — the same reason takeFaulted is a take
// and not a read. A caller that adds a new path into Close now has to say what
// happens to the articles, instead of silently dropping them.
//
// Taken rather than read, on takeFaulted's terms: each set must be routed
// exactly once, and reporting one twice would clear an Emitted bit a later
// dispatch had legitimately set.
//
// The error is unchanged and still reports STORAGE. A non-empty set is a
// defect in this package, not a condition of the volume, so it is deliberately
// not folded into the error: drainAndClose classifies that error into the
// barrier's fault handling, and a bug reported as a storage fault would stall
// a job over a healthy disk.
