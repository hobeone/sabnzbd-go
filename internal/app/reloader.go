// downloader and, at the end, to swap in the new one — stopping the old
// downloader and building/starting the new one happen without app.mu held,
// so app.mu-guarded reads (Speed, ServerStatus, PauseDownloads, etc.) are
// never blocked on downloader shutdown or startup work. See AGENTS.md

	// hand-off, and it did not always hold. Draining moves results onto a
	// buffered work channel; the pwrite happens later, on a worker. The
	// checkpoint below acks what is on disk, so anything still queued to be
	// written would be cleared as outstanding by ClearEmittedForReload and then

	// bytes on disk that the queue still calls outstanding. Clearing Emitted
	// without this offers them again, and #390 is what that costs: the
	// re-fetch goes out on the wire, and if it fails terminally against the
	// NEW server set — likeliest precisely when the reload removed the server
	// that had the article — it is acked permanently failed while its bytes
	// are already on disk. markDone then early-returns on the next barrier's
	// durable ack, because done is already set, so the two disagree
	// permanently: a durable_runs row covers the article while a
	// failed_articles row calls it permanently failed. The
	// inflated failedBytes can reach RepairNoCapacity or
	// RepairBeyondCapacity, both Hopeless(), and the Early Health Gate aborts
	// a job whose file was never damaged.
	//
	// context.Background() rather than app.ctx, for the reason Shutdown's
	// checkpoint uses it: a cancellation racing this must not skip the ack
	// and leave the clear below to run anyway, which is the bug rather than a
	// milder version of it.
	//
	// reloadCheckpointTimeout is the BUDGET, not a wall-clock bound on this
	// call — see its declaration. checkpointJob takes the per-job barrier
	// lock before it consults any context, and sync.Mutex is not
	// context-aware, so a job whose barrier is already running elsewhere is
	// waited for however long that takes. reloadMu is held across all of it
	// and stopWorkers acquires reloadMu with no timeout of its own, so a
	// wedged barrier here delays Shutdown by the same amount. Making that
	// bound real needs a cancellable acquisition in checkpointJob, which is
	// its own change and is still open.
	//
	// The checkpoint is still BEST-EFFORT, but it is no longer silent about
	// it: checkpointAllShare returns the jobs it could not protect, and the
	// clear below withholds their Emitted bits rather than running over every
	// job regardless (#417). What remains best-effort is coverage — a job the
	// budget or a storage fault kept it from acking simply waits for a later
	// barrier.
	//
	// No app.barrier nil check: checkpointAllWithBudget and checkpointJob
	// each already return early on nil, and a third copy here would gate
	// nothing that they do not.
	//
	// The narrower alternative — teach resetForReload to skip an article the
	// WRITER still holds — remains inexpressible at the queue layer, which
	// cannot see what the writer is holding. Ordering is the fix for that.
	//
	// Read that as the narrow claim it is. A queue-layer skip keyed on
	// something the queue CAN be told is expressible, and is what the
	// skipJobIDs argument below does: the checkpoint reports which jobs it
	// failed to protect, per job rather than per article, and the queue acts
	// on that answer without needing to know what any writer holds.
