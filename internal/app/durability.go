// Outstanding is handleArticlesUnwritten's job, which the assembler calls with
// the whole set — including on the paths where the BARRIER routes the fault
// and this function never runs at all.
//
// # Why the routing does not happen here
//
// This runs on the ASSEMBLER'S WORKER GOROUTINE, and both branches block on
// that same goroutine if run inline:
//
//   - Permanent → Application.Fail → maybeFinalize → CloseJobHandles, which
//     enqueues a control message on a.reqs and waits for the worker that is
//     calling it. A guaranteed self-deadlock, resolved only by the 5s
//     closeHandlesTimeout expiring — after which the handles are still open,
//     so the NFS silly-rename that call exists to prevent is not prevented
//     either. maybeFinalize then also does a queue.Save and enqueues
//     post-processing, both on the worker.
//   - Retryable → Application.Stall → Dispatcher.PauseJob, which updates intent
//     manifest from disk and calls into SQLite. On the worker, that is the
//     single goroutine every write for every job passes through.
//
// The assembler's own OnFileComplete comment documents this hazard, and
// app.go's onFileComplete guards against it by handing the work to another
// goroutine. This callback did not.
//
// wg.Add during Wait is ORDINARILY safe because this runs on the assembler
// worker, which Shutdown joins at step 3 — before app.wg.Wait() at step 4.
//
// "Ordinarily" is doing real work in that sentence, and an earlier version
// omitted it. waitBounded ABANDONS its step when the budget expires: it logs
// "shutdown step exceeded budget; abandoning" and returns while the goroutine
// it was waiting on runs on. So a wedged mount that keeps Assembler.Stop past
// its 15s budget lets Shutdown proceed to app.wg.Wait() with the worker still
// draining — and a write fault raised after that point reaches this function
// and Adds to a WaitGroup that already has a waiter, which panics and takes
// the process down before Shutdown's final queue.Save.
//

// here is that the claim is bounded rather than absolute, so nobody builds on
// it. Assembler.drainAndCloseAll declines to route faults at all for exactly

// That is acceptable for a diagnostic: the log line in routeFaulted is the

// They are not redundant, and the reason is not that their cases are disjoint.
// Within one process they are: the assembler resolves its collision's loser

// truncate, the last drain's acks and the size/mtime stamp all need the handle

//
// The bound the trim uses is the highest end offset among the file's DURABLE
// articles, which is neither this run's high-water mark (#342, #350: a resumed
// file would be cut back to what this process happened to fetch) nor the
// gapless prefix (which stops at the first permanently failed article and
// would destroy the very blocks par2 repairs from). Barrier.FinalizeFile owns
// that derivation; this function owns getting it called at all.
//
// # What the result means
//
// nil means the file's bytes on disk are as correct as this process can make
// them: either it was finalized, or there was legitimately nothing to finalize
// (the assembler has stopped, or the job has left the queue — both ordinary,
// and in both cases nothing downstream will act on the file either).
//
// ErrNotFinalized means the opposite, and the caller MUST NOT treat the file
// as complete. It used to return nothing at all, and the caller proceeded
// identically either way — straight into MarkFileComplete, DirectUnpack, job
// finalization and post-processing. That made a barrierOpTimeout on a wedged
// mount indistinguishable from an ordinary shutdown: the file was never
// trimmed, its last drain was never acked, and it was then closed for good and
// shipped with pre-allocation's trailing zeros intact, which par2 reports as
// damage on a download that was perfectly healthy. That is #350 arriving by a
// different route, and it was silent.
//
// The handle is RETAINED on the failing path, reversing the earlier decision
// to close it there. That decision rested on a premise that no longer holds:
// "no path re-triggers a finalize for a file whose parts have all arrived".
// Application.reevaluateStall is now that path, and every operation it needs —
// Drain, Sync, Truncate, Stat — goes through the handle the assembler owns.
// Closing here left the stall unable to clear for the rest of the process,
// which is the L2 violation this reversal exists to remove.
//
// # What the retained set is actually bounded by
//
// Not the concurrently-open set, which is what the close bounded. This is a
// CUMULATIVE set: one fd per completed-but-unfinalized file, held until a
// retry succeeds. Its ceiling is the files that had already completed, or were
// already queued on internalFileComplete, when the fault hit — the open-file
// set plus that channel's 128-entry buffer.
//
// # The bound holds WHILE THE JOB IS PARKED, and a user Resume is the boundary
//
// reevaluateStall does not resume a job until every interrupted finalize has
// landed, so on the automatic path no further file of that job can complete
// and add to the set. An earlier draft resumed first and returned at the first
// failing file, which let each interval complete more files, retry only one of
// them, and retain the rest — an unbounded climb toward EMFILE on a mount that
// stays broken.
//
// A USER Resume is outside that guarantee, and deliberately so: the API's
// queue resume handlers unpause the job and THEN ask for a re-evaluation
// (internal/api/queue.go, queueResumeJobs and queueResumeAll), because a user
// who has cleared the condition is entitled to have their job run. If the
// condition has NOT cleared, that job downloads, completes more files, fails
// each finalize, and retains each handle until the next re-evaluation parks it
// again. The set therefore grows by at most what one re-evaluation interval's
// worth of downloading can complete, per user Resume — not without limit, and
// not silently: each of those files raises its own routed fault.

//
// Barrier.routeFault dispatches every storage fault it meets per A1 — Fail for
// permanent, Stall for retryable — and then RETURNS that same fault as its
// error, so a caller that ignores Stallable still cannot mistake a fault for

// not belt and braces; it is a second, wrong dispatch that overwrites the first.
