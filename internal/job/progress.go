//
// # Why a Complete file's article is left resolved (#426)
//
// A failed article whose file is already Complete stays Done and Failed. The
// combination is ordinary rather than corrupt: a permanently failed article
// keeps its place in the file's part total, so the file still reaches
// TotalParts, finalizes short, and is marked Complete.
//
// Resetting it would create work nothing can perform. ForEachUnfinishedArticle
// skips a Complete file outright, so the article would be counted in Pending
// and never dispatched — the job reports outstanding work forever. Clearing
// Complete instead does not help: the file is finalized, truncated to its
// durable bound, and in the assembler's completed set, which is never cleared
// for the life of the process, so a re-fetched article routes to
// handleLateDuplicate, its buffer is pooled, nothing is written, and it is
// failed again. The reset would buy one wasted fetch per article and arrive
// back here.
//
// Keeping the bytes is the honest figure for the same reason: the article
// really did fail, and unwinding FailedBytes on a file that shipped short
// would understate the damage par2 is being asked to repair.
//
// The narrower guard reloader.go rejects — skipping an article the writer
// still holds — is a different one, and its objection does not apply here. It
// needs knowledge of the writer that this layer does not have; Complete is
// queue-owned state.
// It reports whether it cleared article i's failed bit, which
// ClearEmittedForReload aggregates into its `cleared` return. NO CALLER USES
// THAT RETURN TODAY — `git grep -n 'j\.ClearEmittedForReload(' -- '*.go'
// ':!*_test.go'` finds 2 lines, and both discard it. The per-article answer
// exists so that a caller CAN name the stored rows it may drop: now that the
// reset is not exhaustive, a whole-job delete would forget an article that is
// still failed in memory.
// clearEmitted is false for a job whose reload checkpoint could not make its
// written articles durable (#417). Only the Emitted clear is withheld — the
// un-failing below still runs, because the two act on DISJOINT article sets and
// withholding both would trade one permanent strand for another.
//
// The disjointness, since it is what makes the narrow skip correct: markFailed
// CLEARS emitted as it sets failed, and the un-fail arm below is gated on
// p.failed.Get(i). So a Failed article is never Emitted, and #417's strand is
// caused only by the unconditional emitted.Clear on an article that is
// emitted-and-not-done. Skipping the un-fail instead would leave an article the
// old downloader's teardown failed — ErrNoServersLeft is terminal — failed
// forever: markNotDone refuses a permanently failed article, a restart
